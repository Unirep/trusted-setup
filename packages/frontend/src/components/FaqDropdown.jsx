          The Celestial Call is a momentous occasion within the UniRep
          multiverse. It's a ritualistic gathering that allows participants to
          contribute their unique 'sparks' to the project. Each contribution
          adds to the secure and anonymous framework of UniRep, strengthening
          its fabric and expanding its reach into the privacy-first multiverse.
          This is not merely a technical exercise but an alignment of visions; a
          shared undertaking that invites you to be a part of a new reality
          where privacy is the norm.

          The Celestial Call ceremony will generate the secure proving keys that
          enable UniRep's trustless zero-knowledge system. It ensures that no
          single entity has control over the system, reinforcing the values of
          decentralization communal ownership of technology for societal good.
          It's both an inception and a passage — a way to kickstart the project
          while involving the community in its creation and maintenance.
