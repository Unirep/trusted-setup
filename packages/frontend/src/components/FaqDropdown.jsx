          The Celestial Call is a momentous occasion within the UniRep
          multiverse. It's a ritualistic gathering, if you will, that allows
          participants to contribute their unique 'sparks' to the project. Each
          spark—your contribution—adds to the secure and anonymous framework of
          UniRep, strengthening its fabric and expanding its reach into the
          privacy-first multiverse. This is not merely a technical exercise but
          an alignment of visions, a shared undertaking that invites you to be a
          part of a new reality where privacy is the norm.

        <div>
          In technical terms, the ceremony is essential for setting up a secure
          and trustless system, especially one based on zero-knowledge proofs
          like UniRep. But beyond that, it's about collective creation. The
          ceremony, or The Celestial Call, is an invitation for you to partake
          in something larger than yourself. It ensures that no single entity
          has control over the system, reinforcing the idea of decentralization
          and the communal ownership of technology for societal good. It's both
          an inception and a passage—a way to kickstart the project while
          involving the community intimately in its creation and maintenance.

          After you've chosen your method of authentication, the system will
          automatically download the previous contributions to your local
          machine. You'll then compute your own contributions locally before
          they are uploaded back to our server. Everything is automated for ease
          and convenience. Additionally, you're invited to play around with our
          Cosmos Simulator to create your own mini-multiverse!

          compile all contributions, finalize the transcripts, and unveil the
          collaborative multiverse. You are welcome to revisit and verify your
          individual contribution and the final result.

          like airdrops or tokens. Your contribution stands as a vital support
          to UniRep's secure foundation, and for that, we extend our deepest
          gratitude. Your efforts help construct a shared experience grounded in
          privacy and community.
